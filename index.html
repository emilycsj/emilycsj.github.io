									<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
									<header>
										<h4>Data Scientist @ Ontario Teachers Pension Plan</h4>
										<p>April 2022 - Present, Toronto, ON</p>
									</header>
									<div class="row">
										<h5>Partner with Quantitative Researchers on building trading signals using sentiments and topics from textual data</h5>
											<blockquote>My contribution serves as important foundational components of the NLP systematic trading strategy which will be launched in 2026 which expects to generate <b>$10M-20M value add</b> to the firm, as well as future strategies that use this underlying textual data, output, and logics.</blockquote>
											<ul>
												<li>Designed, built, and optimized data engineering pipeline for earnings transcript processing. Ensuring data integrity, preprocessing quality, and data completeness</li>
												<li>Conducted <b>research and experimentation</b> on accessing vendor data quality and portfolio coverage (S&P 500 Earnings Calls, central bank statements)</li> 
												<li>Processed 124k transcripts covering the entire equity portfolio and generated 300k <b>synthetic sentiment labels</b> using GPT-4o for fine-tuning purpose</li> 
												<li><b>Inferred sentiment (hawkish-dovish)</b> and topics using central bank statements and earnings call transcripts using LLM, experimented different prompting techniques <b>(few-shot, relevance filtering, forward-looking filtering)</b> and inference optimization techniques <b>(KV Cache, flash-attention)</b></li>
												<li>Engineered a parallel API processing script, reducing processing time from over <b>2 hours to 15 mins</b></li>
												<li>Developed an automatic text annotation site using Doccano to facilitate <b>human-in-the-loop</b> labeling</li>
											</ul>
										<h5>Predictive Modelling and traditional Data Science & Analytics</h5>
											<blockquote>I partnered with traders, portfolio managers, and investment professionals to develop and deploy traditional ML models that addressed real trading and investment challenges. Delivered a market regime clustering model to improve trading efficiency and maintaining the trading cost model that became the foundation for pre- and post-trade cost analysis. </blockquote>
											<ul>
												<li>Developed a <b>KMeans</b> Clustering model to classify equity securities under various market features</li>
												<li>Managed daily <b>trade cost predictive model</b> pipeline, monthly broker allocation using <b>Monte Carlo Simulation</b>, and provided ad hoc support for market regime classification model </li>
												<li>Developed Python scripts to auto-generate trading data and created a <b>Trade Cost Analysis PowerBI dashboard</b> for visualizing KPIs, broker analytics, and portfolio manager trading data. The dashboard was used by traders to gain analytical insights quickly and share info with PMs</li>
											</ul>
										<h5>Building Generative AI, Agents and LLMOps</h5>
											<blockquote>I partnered with cross-functional teams (software developers, data engineers, UI/UX designers, stakeholders, and third-party vendors) to build and productionize internal AI platforms and LLM-powered applications, spanning agentic workflows, scalable RAG systems, and GPU-accelerated inference pipelines. These solutions processed tens of millions of records at enterprise scale, standardized model governance and observability, and reduced manual effort by 60% while accelerating insight delivery and issue resolution.</blockquote>
											<ul>
												<li>Architectured a <b>2-tier agent workflow</b> using <b>LangChain</b> to decompose unstructured data into structured schemas; integrated "human-in-the-loop" checkpoints to ensure high-fidelity reasoning and output quality</li>
												<li>Built a <b>modularized NLP codebase and data pipeline</b> (Azure/Snowflake) supporting the extraction and processing of 124k+ transcripts, ensuring data integrity through automated masking and NLP guardrails.</li>
												<li>Engineered a inference pipeline that empowered <b>2 GPUs</b> to infer 20M rows of transcripts using <b>Llama-3.1-8B instruct based model and LoRA adapters</b> for call transcripts sentiment classification</li>
												<li>Engineered an enterprise RAG platform for customer call center support utilizing <b>LangChain, Azure AI Search, and Databricks</b> for high-performance chunking and indexing</li>
												<li>Standardized model lifecycle management using <b>MLflow</b> for metrics governance and LLM observability; achieved a <b>60% reduction in manual effort</b> and accelerated resolution times for complex inquiries by automating information retrieval for support agents.</li>
											</ul>
										<h5>Leadership, Stakeholders Management and Technical Influence</h5>
											<blockquote>I joined as one of the two data scientists in the organization and served as the only DS supporting enterprise-wide data science and advanced analytics capabilities. I became the go-to expert for NLP and ML best practices, driving AI adoption through mentorship, recruiting and onboarding support, and leading inclusive, organization-wide AI knowledge-sharing initiatives.</blockquote>
